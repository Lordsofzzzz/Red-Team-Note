## Red Team Phases

### Key Stages of a Red Team Operation

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   Gather information using tools like OSINT, Nmap, Gobuster, and Shodan.

2. **Enumeration**  
   Identify hosts, services, and vulnerabilities using protocols like SMB, SNMP, LDAP, and Kerberos.

3. **Initial Access**  
   Gain entry through phishing, exploit kits, stolen credentials, or web exploits.

4. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Achieve admin/root access using kernel exploits, misconfigurations, or credential abuse.

5. **Lateral Movement**  
   Expand access across the network using techniques like Pass-the-Hash, RDP hijacking, SMB relay, or Kerberos exploits.

6. **Persistence**  
   Maintain long-term access through scheduled tasks, registry keys, or C2 frameworks.

7. **Exfiltration**  
   Steal sensitive data using data compression, covert channels, or cloud exfiltration.

8. **Evasion Techniques**  
   Avoid detection by manipulating logs, obfuscating actions, or bypassing defenses.

9. **Tools & Cheat Sheets**  
   Access a curated collection of tools to streamline your operations.
